Game name idea: Bad Apple


Quest: increase difficulty of next boss
Several decks. Easy encounters, medium, hard etc 
Increasing difficult once is good (harder encounter for better rewards). But increasing multiple times is bad (more likely to be wiped). Introduces dynamic where bad Apple will want to:
- not increase if they think party hasn’t
- Increase if they think party has
Maybe difficulty of encounter is rolled at time of encounter. Each difficulty increase has a chance of applying. That was plausible deniability remains.

card idea:

maybe once bad apple is revealed, he is able to draw from bad apple exclusive deck.

powerful late game game-ending cards:
"Bad Apple-pocalypse" -> kill all heroes.


can other players draw from this too in the early game? 
* bad apple cards get removed from non bad apple on reveal
* leads to power spikes in short term, but leads to more confusion on deduction of identity of bad apple.

maybe rewards can be drafted piles of cards like citadels

maybe a quest type of system where fulfilling certain conditions gives you rewards, makes you morepowerful, allows bad apple to scale final encounter.

these quests would be things that cause "weird behaviour". 
eg. 
"deal combat damage to another player" -> gain 3c
"fizzle another player's spell" -> gain 2c
