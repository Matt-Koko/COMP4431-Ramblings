card type:

i like the tension between private/public information

maybe i can have cards/equipment that you can

when interfacing with map + choosing where to go next:
maybe "seer" type role can get partial information about the event
if it's treasure: is the chest cursed/mimic? is the reward a trinket/equipment/loot?

been struggling with how to allow bad man to do bad acts in tabletop setting

perhaps make game have digital component, so bad man is able to interact with the game systems from their pc

Thoughts about digital/tabletop hybrid game:

benefit - less maintainance/upkeep. Traditional tabletop games require players to manually interface with each system (moving tokens around, changing health values, etc.). If some of these chores could be reduced, I see that as an upside.

downside - if you're not careful, you could end up in a situation where players are "hiding" behind the screen. I want this game to be driven by social interactions, so there needs to be some systems/mechanics requiring players to interface with the physical table and their fellow players.
