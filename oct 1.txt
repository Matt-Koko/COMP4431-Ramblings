Idea for class:
Class who adds time to clock in exchange for buffs. (Cards with overclock?) 

Could be all self buffs. I become stronger in exchange for the final boss being harder. Introduces player choice. Player wants to become more powerful, but party might want to discourage overclocking. Opportunity for bad man shenanigans.
