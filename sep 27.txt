have been struggling with problem of
"how can bad man have extra info/privelages in tabletop setting"?

exploration of other games:
- one night ultimate werewolf
- mafia
- chameleon
- secret hitler

most games have a "night phase" or similar, where players close their eyes to allow for assmetric information.

in a game spanning multiple rounds, many decisions, this system has downsides:
- would be too cumbersome 
- might still give away who bad man is

so have been struggling with solution:
- one was to hybridise the game, have electronic componenet
- but this doesn't work unless it's fluid integration
- (eg of crypto and not having representation in real world)

for a while i was thinking to just digitise the game
(it would still be a tabletop game)
- every player sits at the table with a laptop
- voting can still happen physically
- hands, cards, decks, etc. are all digitsed
- but you lose tactility
- raise the barrier to entry (laptops are required to play)

instead, can go for hybrid model, where each player plays with phone
- "everyone has a phone in their pocket anyways"
- state is preserved with app/web app 
- QR codes to make state sync as smooth as possible
- or maybe just take picture of entire hand/board and app will parse the cards

Card idea:
“… and a sesame seed bun”
“No more cards can be played on this stack.
To play: must be your first card played when given priority.”

Seperate decks colour coordinated to players? Allows for cards to interact with colour. “Choose the targets for the next red spell to resolve”

What if everyone’s deck is different? Inspired by other asymmetric games like Root.

Maybe each turn “draw until you have X cards”. So you can hold on to powerful cards if you want, but you are incentivised to use cards given as best you can to draw more.


Card idea:
“Lemon Eon”

General goal of game.
Players must collaborate to get the most out of their cards and beat boss encounters.
