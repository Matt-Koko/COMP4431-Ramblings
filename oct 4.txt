map idea:
maybe the question mark encounters, instead of being the same random event for all members of the party, should be a secret random event for each player?

player stats

on your player card, you have various "tracks" with 2 counters. 1 is the threshold (what the stat resets to after each encounter). 2 is the current value of that stat. various card will say "Gain +2 bonus Strength." etc.
