Wrote first draft of setting flavour text (update as mechanics are finalised):

There is a dark force brewing in the far reaches of Savora. Populated by fruity citizens of pulp and pith, the kingdom has enjoyed an extended period of peace and prosperity. However, increasing competition from a rival foodstuff export group, Kaoko Inc, has burdened Savora with financial hardship, blanketing the land in tension and distrust. The Savorian Council of Five have long suspected that Kaoko Inc employ forbidden arts and the services of rotten wizards to drive their meteoric growth and ever-expanding influence. Now, concerning reports of Kaoko creations animated to life – Chocogolems and Mallowraiths – attacking Savorians have prompted the nobility of Savora to take action. 

You are a band of unlikely heroes enlisted by the Queen herself and tasked with venturing into the heart of Kaoko Inc’s factories to find the source of corruption that is twisting the minds of the Savorians. However, your journey will not be without peril. One of you have secretly pledged allegiance to Kaoko Inc, making you the Bad Apple. Will you successfully complete your quest, or will you fall victim to the Bad Apple’s subterfuge?
